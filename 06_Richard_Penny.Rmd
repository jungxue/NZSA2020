# Richard Penny | Modelling for COVID in Official Economic Time Series {-}

## NZSTATS

5000 time series per quarter
must be robust and automated

mainly seasonally adjusted trend and estimated

TS expert adjust variables, result for users

time series must be consistent, people hated change

need to do things right the forst time

COVID affect different places at different time

RegARIMA,

add a covid variable B_iX_it

possible covid effects outlier, level shift, ramp, step functoion

not enough data, noise, etc made it hard to identify the trend

red flages, covid values made so much impact seasonality started to signii=ficantly shift 

visitor arrivals goes to 0

we cannot assume any model for COVID priod, and may have profound long term effect for future arrivals

what can we expect 

seasonal breaks

merging data? 

North and south hemisphere seasonality??
