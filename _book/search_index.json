["how-to-use-rbookdown.html", "How to use RBookDown", " How to use RBookDown Firstly, you must read the RBookDown Bible by YiHui Xie In essence, you write in a mixture of markdown (For basics), html (to extend on markdown) and latex language (mostly for equations) to create a simple Note. You can customise your style and theme through your own CSS. RMarkdown are mostly preferably used to knit e-books(HTML), use TexStudio if you want a proper printable PDF, Latex will be easier. Here are some useful tips to get started 1: To add a chapter, just open a R file and save as .RMD. Use number 0 to 99 with a hyphen - to order the RMD files and maybe add a Chapter name so it is easier to select from Files window at bottom right of the R Studio. 2: Code chunks can generate graphical outputs, To insert pictures just use include_graphics instead of \\includegraphics{} or ![](). Width can be customised. knitr::include_graphics(rep(&#39;images/knit-logo.png&#39;, 3)) 3: Use 1 grave accent ` to include the inline code, use 3 grave accent to include a chunk of code. 4: use {-} to stop automatic chapter names 5: Often you have tables, you can copy the table to a excel file and convert table to markdown tables, using Online Websites "]
