## Subsection 

Image processing to improvedata quality

ie zoom in area of interest

histogram equalization (improve contrast)

noise reduction using filters

mage enhancing algorithms

summarise feature into 1 d

histogram of orientated gradient (HOG)

gain 2 d image gradient turninto a histogram

hetrogenity, image from same sourece more similar

local HOg feature comparison
