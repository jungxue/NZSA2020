# Susmita Das | A machine learning model to identify private dwellings from admin data {-}

## Back ground

census immuerate resident dwellimg and collect attributes

can we not use census, instead use administravive data

2018 had lower thane xpected response rate

can we move into fullt administarvive census

current collection method, address list, info to make sure address is up to date, 

obj of study: model to predict private dwelling from administative data

prison, businesss, not private dwelling

**why predict dwelling**

address will not tell you whether this is a dwelling or not

address have insights 

assumptions: every address is unique
dwelling work as privcate residence
address linked in admin data is current

work with anomaised address for security reason

need to dicide for threshld


Future work

Assessment of assumptons
