treat and calculate using existing data


Desired properties

Predictive accuracy
ranking accuracy
distribution accuracy

imputation plausibility: impyationvalues that are plausible

clean dataset to assess imputation

response mechanism

pearsons correlation, good impytation should have R2 close to 1

Household Evalaution Survey 2015 first used 

income, age sex etc+ demographics 

imputation method

Key variable: income

Larger weight for more significant variables,
