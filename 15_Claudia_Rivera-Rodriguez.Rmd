# Claudia Rivera-Rodriguez | Optimal sampling allocation for outcome dependent designs in cluster-correlated data settings {-}

## intro

Allocation => given N, how many do we sample?

we are interested in regression 

weighted genealised estimating equation

remind your self about minimizing 

My thought: can tables be more concise and clear compare to multipple similar plots?(ie heat map)
